$faq[] = array('Please read the following rules and guidelines', 'By proceeding to post in the forum, you agree to these guidelines and must obey them at all times. This guide is designed to strike a balance between the main goal of the Icy Phoenix website, providing information and support, and keeping the relaxed and welcoming atmosphere of Icy Phoenix. We require all posts to be positive, constructive, and on topic. We reserve the right to remove any topics or individual posts that we deem inappropriate or disruptive. Please note that, from time to time, topics may be removed for being inappropriate even though your individual post in that topic may have been perfectly fine. You may not make personal attacks on other users either in the forums or private messages. You may not use profanity:- it is unprofessional and offensive, and will not be tolerated. You may not advertise or promote other companies or their programmes in this website. We reserve the right to ban any member who violates our guidelines or disrupts the forum. We will be fair and provide a warning in most cases. If you have an issue concerning our services, policies, or staff, please use a personal contact method such as a private message or email to an administrator or moderator - they are highlighted in the active members list. We take serious complaints to heart and will do our best to address them.');
$faq[] = array('Profanity', '1. There will be no excessive use of profanity. Any excessive uncalled-for language will be removed and you will receive a final warning.');
$faq[] = array('Personal Discriminations', '2. There will be no racial, ethnic, gender based insults or any other forms of personal discrimination.');
$faq[] = array('Offensive or Inflammatory', '3. There will be no posts meant to offend or hurt any other member, in a manner which is offensive or inflammatory.');
$faq[] = array('Spamming', '4. Spamming is not permitted; please keep all your posts as constructive as possible.');
$faq[] = array('Pornography', '5. Pornographic images, pirate software, or any other illegal transactions may NOT be linked in any shape or form.');
$faq[] = array('Post Property', '6. All posts are property of the author. This forum and all web sites owned in conjunction with this forum have the right to request alteration or deletion of any offensive post. Posts may be deleted for any reasons the forum administrators deem reasonable.');
$faq[] = array('Pictures', '7. Pictures may be posted as long as they are not sexually explicit or offensive. If you plan to post more than one image, or the topic is based on graphics, please link the images rather than screening them.');
$faq[] = array('Signatures', '8. Signatures may contain images, but may not be any larger than 300x100; 468x60 banners are also permitted (within reason - they must not be to advertise a company product). If your signature is larger than the allotted size given or deemed unacceptable by staff, you will be requested by a moderator to resize or change your image. Please also try and keep text signatures under 5 lines. Failing to comply with a moderator\'s request will result in the removal of your signature.');
$faq[] = array('Advertising', '9. Advertising commercially-related products is forbidden in any relation to your account.');
$faq[] = array('Correct area to post', '10. Remember to post in the correct area. Take your time to look at other topics to see where your topic should go. If your topic is placed in the wrong forum, it will be moved by a moderator. If a topic is recognized as being posted in the wrong forum, or if the post is a violation of our guidelines then please contact a moderator either via PM or the "report post to moderator" feature; please do not respond publicly to the member.');
$faq[] = array('Impersonation', '11. Any impersonation of a user from these forums, in any mode of communication, is strictly prohibited and will result in a banning. ');
$faq[] = array('External Content', '12. If you are linking to external content, you should link directly to that content. It is unacceptable to use link-thru systems to mask the originating URL, and cases where this is found to be happening may be edited or removed as appropriate.');
$faq[] = array('Violation', '13. Violation of any of these rules will result in consequences determined on a case-by-case basis.');
